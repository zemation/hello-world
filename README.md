# hello-world

Greetings fellow tech heads.  
I just wanted to take this time to give a little insight into me..  
I've been working with computers for over 20 years.
I have several industry certifications specializing in Windows, Linux and Cloud.
I have been building my main website up with HTML and CSS recently working in Bootstrap and soon to add JavaScript.
I'm now starting to work on some development tasks using Python.
I continue to work on furthering my career within the Cloud especially Amazon Web Services.  
A long term goal is develop out an idea of "Social Media of You".  One that specializes in the user profile.  
I am also looking to create an online learning aggregation service.
