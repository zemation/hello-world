# hello-world

Greetings fellow tech heads.  
I just wanted to take this time to explain me.  
I've been working with computers for over 20 years.  
I'm now starting to work on some development things and learn Python and maybe some C.
I have 5 different websites I have for different aspects of my hobbies.  
I have been building the main site in html/css/bootstrap from the ground up. 
I have also put it in a mini pipeline.  A home jenkins instance takes it from github and pushes it to my vps.  
I am also looking to create an online learning aggregation service.
